  abstract = {We present a fast and accurate computational method for solving and estimating a class of dynamic programming models with discrete and continuous choice variables. The solution method we develop for structural estimation extends the endogenous grid-point method (EGM) to discrete-continuous (DC) problems. Discrete choices can lead to kinks in the value functions and discontinuities in the optimal policy rules, greatly complicating the solution of the model. We show how these problems are ameliorated in the presence of additive choice-specific independent and identically distributed extreme value taste shocks that are typically interpreted as ``unobserved state variables'' in structural econometric applications, or serve as ``random noise'' to smooth out kinks in the value functions in numerical applications. We present Monte Carlo experiments that demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the DC-EGM algorithm and the associated maximum likelihood estimator for structural estimation of a life-cycle model of consumption with discrete retirement decisions.},

abstract="This article reviews the history and theory of dynamic programming (DP), a recursive method of solving sequential decision problems under uncertainty. It discusses computational algorithms for the numerical solution of DP problems, and an important limitation in our ability to solve realistic large-scale dynamic programming problems, the `curse of dimensionality'. It also summarizes recent research in complexity theory that delineates situations where the curse can be broken (allowing us to solve DPs using fast polynomial time algorithms), and situations where it is insuperable. The literature on econometric estimation and testing of DP models is reviewed, as is another `scientific limit to knowledge', namely, the identification problem.",

    abstract = {In the US, both taxes and old-age social security benefits depend on oneâ€™s marital status and tend to reduce the labour supply of the secondary earner. To what extent are these provisions holding back the female labour supply? We estimate a rich dynamic life-cycle model of labour supply and savings for couples and singles using the Method of Simulated Moments for the 1945 and 1955 birth cohorts. Our model matches well the life-cycle profiles of labour market participation, hours, and savings for married and single people, and generates plausible elasticities of labour supply. It implies that eliminating these marriage-related provisions would drastically increase the participation of married women over their entire life cycle, reduce the participation of married men after age 60, and increase savings. If the resulting government surplus were used to lower income taxation, there would be large welfare gains for the vast majority of the population. These results hold for both cohorts, including the later one, which has participation similar to that of more recent generations.},
